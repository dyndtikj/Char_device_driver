# Char_device_driver

## Description

Linux kernel module for symbolic devices (count can be defined in mychardev.c).<br/>

To make, insmod and test module write ***./run.sh*** command, you will see an inteface for testing.<br/>
To clean all beside sourse files make target clean (***make clean***).<br/>

## Instruction
<br/>
Read command reads from ***current offset***, you can change offset without closing, use ***lseek***.<br/>
Write command writes to ***current offset***, writting to the opened file will add data, not rewritting, to rewrite close file or use ***lseek*** function.<br/>

## Testing program example:

- Firstly opened file and writed 5 symbols
- Then without closing added 8 symbols (to current offset)
- To read from begin wihtout reopening use lseek
- Read 4 symbols from begin
- Then read 5 from current offset
- Move offset to begin and read all
- As we see driver works correctly(* as author expected)
